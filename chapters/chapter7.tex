\section{Error handling}
Error handling is important, but it should never conceal the logic.

\subsection{Exceptions}
Exceptions are the preferred way to report errors. Martin suggests that exceptions should be unchecked because checked exceptions violate the open closed principle. [TODO: citation needed]
Like every other part of the code, exceptions should be well named and provide context about where and why they occured.

\subsection{Special case object}
Code that checks for null on every third line is ugly, hard to read and definitely not clean. Instead of returning null when a value is missing or not present the special case object pattern should be used:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Swift, caption={Function that uses the special case object pattern}]
func getFavourites() -> [Image] {
    var favourites: [Image] = []
    for image in images {
        if image.isFavorite {
            favourites.append(image)
        }
    }
    return favourites
}
\end{lstlisting}

With this pattern we try not to return null but a 'special object' in this case just the empty list. The special cases should be handled in the callee, not the caller. Null should also never be used as a function argument.
