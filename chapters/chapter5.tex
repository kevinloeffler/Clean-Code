\section{Formatting}
Almost all code is read top to bottom, left to right. Good Formatting helps developers to read code. Line breaks between different concepts, e.g. import statements and class declaration help to visually separate the two. Local variables should be in the beginning of their scope. Methods that get called should be lower than their caller. Lines should never be more than 120 characters wide.

\subsection{Teamwork}
Every developer has their own style and formatting preferences but when working in a team there should be a unified code style that everyone follows. Ideally it is enforced by the IDE.
