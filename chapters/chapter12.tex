\section{Conclusion}
In the last part of the book Martin gives several in depth examples how to improve bad code. These pages are very code heavy and I recommend that every developer takes a look at them. My conclusion is that the book despite it being long, was an interesting read and I have learned a lot of small things and good practices that will improve my daily work.
