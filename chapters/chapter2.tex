\section{Naming}

\subsection{Descriptive Names}
Names should always describe why they exist and what they do. If a variable declaration needs a comment it has already failed.

\center{\small{Bad and good vriable names}}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Swift]
let d: int;  // elapsed time in days
let elapsedTimeInDays: int;  // descriptive = no comment needed
\end{lstlisting}
\raggedright

Additionally, variables should always have names that are pronounceable and searchable. A variable named '\texttt{x}' is very hard to ever find again.

\subsection{Honest Names}
When using programming concepts in our names, developers should be careful not to misuse a name. For example a variable that is called '\texttt{accountList}' should really be a list and not some other data structure. Much better would be an implementation agnostic name like '\texttt{accounts}'.
