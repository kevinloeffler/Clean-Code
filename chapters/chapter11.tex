\subsection{Emergent design}
The four rules proposed by Kent Beck in his book Simple Design \cite{XPE} help write clean software through emergent design:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The code passes all tests
    \item The code does not contain dublications
    \item The code embodies the intention of the developer
    \item The code minimizes the number of classes and methods
\end{enumerate}
